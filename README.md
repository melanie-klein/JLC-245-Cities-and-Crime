## Course Description
Urban areas face many significant challenges, of which crime is one of the most significant. Crime-plagued areas do not occur in a vacuum. This course explores the factors correlated with crime with a focus on the modern American city, particularly Washington, D.C. The course frames the issues using historical and theoretical perspectives to provide context for social scientific studies and policy work in this area. Students gain an appreciation for the complexity of addressing crime in urban areas as well as a solid foundation for advanced course work in criminology, sociology, and urban studies. 

Upon completion of this course students should have a practical comprehension of the relationship between crime and cities, an introduction to different types of analytic methods, and a more nuanced appreciation for social science research. This course will provide a foundation for advanced course work and studies in criminology, as well as the skills to obtain jobs like these. Students also will gain a better understanding of urban communities and how crime affects a city and its neighborhoods. 

## Learning Outcomes
- Examine crime in U.S. cities, including a consideration of the institutions and policies designed to address urban crime and their evolution over time. This outcome will be achieved through projects analyzing crime data at national and local levels. 
- Employ theoretical explanations of crime focusing on community context and place. This outcome will be achieved through reading materials, in-class lectures and discussion, and projects analyzing non-crime factors at national and local levels. 
- Apply theoretical explanations and evaluate secondary data in the context of Washington, D.C. to understand the effects of community dynamics, institutional relations, and crime prevention strategies at the neighborhood level. This outcome will be achieved through a series of statistical and spatial analytic projects.
