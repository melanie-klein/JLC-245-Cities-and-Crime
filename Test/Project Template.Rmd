# Welcome!

When you first load this file, you'll notice a banner across the top about packages needing to be installed. Click **install** - this will save you extra coding steps later.

*Whenever you want to see what this output looks like*, **click the 'Knit' button.** The output file, which is an **.HTML** file, will be saved to the same folder this script is saved to. You'll notice the file name in the top left of the output window, too.

# Themes

The first section, lines 1-6, is the header. This is the basic version. If you'd like something fancier, you can experiment with styles. Specifically, change the **output** section to something like this:

    output: 
      cleanrmd::html_document_clean:
        theme: markdown-modest
        toc: yes
        toc_float: 
        collapsed: true
And you'll get a new style.

If you want to experiment further, swap out the **markdown-modest** theme. Here are other markdown themes to try:

    “almond”, “awsm.css”, “axist”, “bamboo”, “bullframe”, "cayman", “holiday”, “kacit”, “latex.css”, “markdown-splendor”, “markdown-retro”, “markdown-air”, “markdown-modest”, “marx”, “minicss”, “new.css”, “no-class”, “picocss”, “sakura”, “sakura-vader”, “semantic”, “simplecss”, “style-sans”, “style-serif”, “stylize”, “superstylin”, “tacit”, “vanilla”, “water”, “water-dark”, “writ”

# Formatting

Here's a collection of text formatting/styling things you may (or may not) care about. Copy them, use them, or delete them, just don't leave all of this here when you submit your project...

There's a [useful link here](https://www.rforecology.com/post/how-to-use-rmarkdown-part-one/).

And here's [another one](https://sage-fenglisu-c38dfb.netlify.app/). 

[Here's a great link](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) for creating tables as visuals in your file.

Both of the examples above show you how to hyperlink text. That's useful when you want to cite something, without providing the URL in the text.

These are different heading styles. When you 'knit' this template, you see how they differ:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

### *Italics*
### **Bold**
### ***Bold Italicized***

1. Numbered
2. List
3. Like
4. This

* bullet points
- work
* like this
- or this

# Hiding Code
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide', warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# when you set 'echo' to false, you are hiding the block of code 
# when you set 'message' to false, you are hiding the console text that comes after running your code
# when you set 'results' to hide, you are hiding extra processing that occasionally shows up in the console
# when you set fig.show to hide, you are hiding the plot output
```
See how the chunk of code above doesn't show up in the knitted output? It's magic, really.

# Running Packages
```{r}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages('formatdown')
library(formatdown)
```
**NOTE:** *Never ever ever include any install.packages functions.* Either comment them out with a #, or delete them.

Also, if we had used the message=FALSE here, all that extra stuff would not have displayed in the knit.

# Example
```{r}
# Data set included in formatdown
data("metals")

# Extract two columns
DT <- metals[, .(metal, elast_mod)]

# Format one column
DT$elast_mod <- format_numbers(DT$elast_mod, digits = 3, format = "engr")
# Format the text column
DT$metal <- format_text(DT$metal)

# Display the table
knitr::kable(DT, col.names = c("metal", "modulus (Pa)"))
```

# Recommended Workflow

1. Create a new, blank .R file for each project.
2. Use this file to build all the things you need for a project, including examples from class and instructions.
3. Create a .Rmd file (or *Save As* this file as a start-point).
4. Copy/paste only the content you need from the .R file to the .Rmd file.
5. Test, edit, proofread, knit, submit the output to Canvas.

**NOTE:** When submitting your projects, you are submitting an **HTML** output of your Markdown file. You will never ever ever submit the .Rmd fie - you are submitting the knitted out of the .Rmd file.
